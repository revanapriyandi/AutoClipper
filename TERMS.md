# Terms of Service for AutoClipper

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the AutoClipper desktop application (the "Software") operated by the developers of AutoClipper ("us", "we", or "our").

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using AutoClipper, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not use the Software.

## 2. License

AutoClipper is an open-source tool distributed under the **MIT License**. You are granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, subject to the conditions of the MIT License text included in the repository.

## 3. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability

### A. "As Is" Basis

The Software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from, out of, or in connection with the software.

### B. Third-Party Platform Policies

AutoClipper automates the process of editing and publishing video content to third-party platforms (like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook).

- **Compliance:** You are solely responsible for ensuring that the content you generate and publish complies with the Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and Copyright Policies of those third-party platforms.
- **Account Bans/Strikes:** We are not responsible for any shadow-bans, account suspensions, copyright strikes, or loss of revenue you may incur as a result of using this automation tool. You use the publisher features at your own risk.

### C. API Costs

The Software connects to various paid APIs (e.g., OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Deepgram) based on the keys you provide. You are solely responsible for monitoring your usage and paying any associated costs billed by those third-party providers.

## 4. User Responsibilities

- You agree not to use AutoClipper to generate or distribute illegal, hazardous, defamatory, or explicit content where prohibited by law or platform guidelines.
- You are responsible for securing your workstation. Since AutoClipper stores your API keys locally in the OS Keychain, physical access to your unlocked machine could potentially expose your tokens.

## 5. Modifications to the Software

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Software or any service to which it connects, with or without notice and without liability to you.

## 6. Contact Information
